## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecom scenario. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or cease their subscription to a service. Understanding the reasons behind churn and identifying potential churners are crucial for telecom companies to retain their customers and improve their services.

## Tools Used
1. Python: Utilized for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
2. DAX: Data Analysis Expressions for data manipulation and analysis.
3. Power BI: Visualization tool used to create interactive dashboards.

## Agenda
The main agenda of this project is to provide an overview of churn in a telecom scenario. Key aspects covered in the analysis include:

* Gender impact on churn
* Tenure impact on churn
* Senior citizen status and its impact on churn
* Phone service and its relation to churn
* Presence of online security measures and its effect on churn
* Types of internet service (fiber optic, DSL, None) and their influence on churn
* Contract types (monthly, two-year, one-year) and their correlation with churn
* Average monthly charges and their relation to churn
* Average total charges and their impact on churn

## Data Visualization
Visualizing the above aspects through interactive dashboards provides insights into the factors influencing customer churn in the telecom industry.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the various factors contributing to churn, telecom companies can devise strategies to retain customers and improve their services, ultimately reducing churn rates and enhancing customer satisfaction.
